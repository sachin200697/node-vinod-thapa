npm i hbs //hbs is handlebars

This is similar to ejs -> used to create dynamic web pages for front end.

To work with hbs there should be a folder with unique name views then to create
a html file we need to create it inside views with extension .hbs(not html) then
in index.js(in server) we need to tell node that what is the view engine(hbs or
ejs or some other ) we are going to use.

app.set("view engine", "hbs"); //for ejs app.set("view engine", "ejs");

then serve the request by setting a route:

app.get("/", (req, res)=>{ res.render("index"); //instead of send or end we need
to render the file

    <!-- to send the dynamin data se can pass sencond agrument as an object -->
    // res.render("index", {name: "Sachin"});

}

<!-- to use the dynamin data inside .hbs file -->
<h1>{{name}}</h1>


Note: If we want to change the name of vieww folder then we need to tell express as well. Steps:
1. Change the name of views folder suppose 'examples'
2. const app = express();
3. app.set('views', path_of_changed_folder)
