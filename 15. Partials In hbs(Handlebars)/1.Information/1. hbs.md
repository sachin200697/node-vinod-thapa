Partials: To use a file in other file. It is similar to the component.

To use Partials:
1. const hbs = require('hbs);
2. hbs.registerPartials(Path_of_folder_in_which_partials_are_present);

Suppose we have a folder partials in views folder and inside partials there is a file for header -> header.hbs
and we want to include it in index.hbs then use bwlow in index.hbs->
{{>header}} //this will automatially inclide the file like a component.


Problem: By default nodemon will look only the changes in .js files not in .hbs and alos not in other extensions
as well so to improve it we need to run the server with following command :
nodemon index.js -e hbs,html,js //can mention other extensions if required
